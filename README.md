# Hello_World5
This is an equivalent repository written in Haskell to showcase different languages.

## Description
This repositiory contains a HelloWorld.hs file. This is a simple GitHub repo that is supposed to show how one looks and
explain how to clone this repo onto your own GitHub. Once you do this and understand the Git commands, you will be able to 
make your own private repos to display your work. 

This program uses the IO monad to interact with the console and read user input. It first prints a greeting message and 
prompts the user to press the enter key. It then reads a line of input from the user and checks whether it is empty or not. 
If the input is empty, it calls the printMessage function to print a message. Otherwise, it enters a loop that repeatedly 
prompts the user to enter empty input until they do so. Finally, it prints a message and terminates.
